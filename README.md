![Ordak Gallerylogo](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery/blob/master/assets/images/logo/ordak_gallery_logo.jpg)

##### Milestone project 1 (Prepared for the User Code Institute/Centric Frontend Development module)

Direct link to the project is [here.](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery.git)

### Project Goal
No artist names no price tag. Think of an online gallery (focusing on painting) where is safe to browse and being inspired. The goal is not usual. Here the aim is to establish a communication with the visitors and get their feedback and opinion on art pieces. It aims to earn the honest feedback from visitors without knowing the artist and the prices. By knowing the user's feeling, it would be possible to instate a better communication in order to fulfil their art desire. The price is not the first aim but creating an environment for visitors to express their opinion and need via email.

- there should be easy and comfortable ways of contacting and communicating with Ordak Gellery management 
- It is important that the visitors should not be pushed for buying the art pieces and visitors should not be targeted by marketing emails.

### Website Overview
Ordak Gallry does not provide any price tag or artist name and users need to contact the galley if they are motivated by the piece(s). All other art gallery websites try to sell the art by highlighting  artist fame and the history of the piece so users are considered to be collationers or investors. The purpose here is to create a link with visitors and help them in choosing the right piece of art without distracted by commercial side. The aim is to educate visitors about art and help them to enjoy artworks. There are pages with links to external material for reading, visiting or even apply for a degree in art.
At the end those who have sent email will be reached for further advise on buying/renting or getting familiar with art pieces.


### Website Description and Demonstration

The website is trying to put an experimental approach into test on art (painting) business by focusing more on the art by itself rather than the other usual galleries where the price and fame of the artist is the heart of the business or they bombard the visitors with endless information and options and even non related objects.
Website benefits from different page entries each has useful material to attract and entertain the visitors.


## UX

### Business Strategy

Is it possible to penetrate a market of art (painting) which is saturated, Chaotic and has huge potential at the same time? Most of the artists and art lovers are frustrated by the situation.  Usual online galleries provide too many options with a lot of details which is mostly useful for collectors, art dealers and investors. Psychologically displaying the price tag and the name of the artist makes decision very difficult for the any customer or art lover. The usual way or style creates a distraction for visitors and usually makes the visitor brain lobes fight with each other. Most of the time people are afraid of going to a gallery for enjoyment and afraid of self-indulgence. While. In our approach we want the users feel they are always welcome to start a conversation about their interest and if they are interested, they can evaluate the economical side of it. In case they should be approached in a comfortable and secure way without worrying about their pockets. That is why we will be providing them first with consulting through Ordak Gallery.


### Business Goal
- The major goal is to benefit from art market business opportunities in a chaotic market which is difficult to penetrate and stay sustainable.
- There are many talents who are living under the shadow of famous figures or does not have a proper platform to promote their works. It is tried to promote those talents through an innovative approach.
- The website is focused on painting therefore should be soon a base for many artists 
- Art market needs different approach to reach paintings and their creators.

### Visitors Stories

- Someone who wants a change in her house and add some painting to her house walls need help and advise on choosing them. therefore, the gallery could provide her immediate advise via email or phone without distract her by price tag or artist fame. She can purchase the art piece and change it if she feels so or even try to check a few ones to see which one give her what she is looking for.

- A lawyer who has no art background and wants to make her office attractive and create a better environment for her clients is asking for help and easily could get idea from the website without being bombarded by thousands of pieces of art which might create a big confusion for her.

- A doctor whose surgery is already covered by some sad and cold pieces of paintings wants to change them and hang more vibrant paintings which can improve his patientâ€™s mood and relax them while waiting for their turn. Ordak gallery provides him with advise on his requirement with no pain. 

- An international event organiser wants to rent few art pieces for a top-class meeting room requires economic and fresh art pieces without hassle of searching in the art chaotic market. Ordak Gallery will provide her with quick and economical options while quality and class of the art is guaranteed.

- A hotel management needs few good quality art pieces for their lobby at the hotel. They need to match the art pieces with their architecture and design and create more friendly, calm, and beautiful environment for their client without putting too much time and cost with at risk. Ordak Gallery will provide them with consultancy and even takes order or get commissioned by them.  

## Website Feature Scope

The website has following features: 

-- pages 
- Home (First page with links to all other pages)
- Art Works (where visitors will watch the artwork images)
- Inspirations (Here user can get inspired by real life experience of an artist)
- Interesting Events (where to visit and educational opportunities in art are introduced)
- Useful Reading (material that increase knowledge and awareness related to art)
- Contact Us (visitors can send messages/email)

>- Based on our approach there is no price tags or artist name or even art piece name listed in the gallery page.

Other features such as social media links and a contact phone number are included under each page.


## Technologies Used 

- This website is benefited from HTML, CSS programming languages and methods.

- For most of the coding the gitpod coding environment was utilised and for some testing Microsoft VSC was engaged.
Major tests were on Chrome web browser and Microsoft Edge for a test. 

- Menu bars specially are customised by bootstrap help.



### Website File Structure

- image files are loaded under assets folder\images
- Images folder have subfolders named after each artists.
- Under each artist folder there is an artwork and inspiration (insp) folder separating gallery and inspirations files.

![Image](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery/blob/master/assets/images/readme/file_structure.jpg)


### Coding Structure
- Menu bar and artwork pictures are structured after Bootstrap version is 4.3.1
- font-awesome link is not added inside the <head></head> because it does not exist under Bootstrap version 4.3.1 and it might not be necessary!!!!
- hover effect is 'taken' from https://cdnjs.com/libraries?q=hover
- Galley Rooms is the same as Art Works of the menu. 

### Potential Future Developments and plans
- May be in future a mini biography (preferably an autobiography) for artists in general will be added
- Adding a simple paragraph to each artwork so visitors could stablish connection with them
- Creating a 2D imaginary gallery plot with rooms and salons with hovering and selecting capabilities. Each room is dedicated to a single artist and some exhibitions could be held there.
- there will be videos and inspirations material to be added in future
- Possibly a rating system based on number of view, visitor rating, and feedback
- Adding a filtering system so user can filter the type of art work based on style, media, artist etc
- Sorting system for sorting the displayed pictures
- More interesting sources for reading and more inspiration places and places to visit will be added
- Based on user experience colours may improvement

###  Further immediate improvements to be done
- The menus hover functionality need improvement

As a result, the website is fully functional on different devices. 



## Bug Fixing and Validation 

The following technologies were used for validating the codes.

HTML - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) - Markup Validation

CSS - [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - CSS Validation


The validation shows a series of error which was fixed:


>- CSS errors: style.css file

![CSS:](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery/blob/f85afa3d666a3d4870a42051602b18cf835eb241/assets/images/readme/CSS_validation.JPG)


>- HTML errors: interesting.html and useful.html files

![HTML:](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery/blob/f85afa3d666a3d4870a42051602b18cf835eb241/assets/images/readme/HTML_validation.JPG)

all above were fixed.


### Microsoft Edge bug:
The default value for email anchor "target" attribute is equal to "_self" if the quotation mark is left empty however in Microsoft Edge â€œ_blank" value is taken therefore by pressing email icon at bottom of each page a new contact page was started which was not quite intuitive. Therefore, all pages were corrected and value of "_self" is assigned inside the quotations.

## Deployment
- The project locates at the github address [Ordak Gallery](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery.git)


## Credits

All the art works and images are real and taken from real artist Anahita Aboutorabi and Simin Hormozi. Their permission was quite important for my new experience. 

## Acknowledgments
