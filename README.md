##### This milestone project is prepared for the User Code Institute/Centric Frontend Development module

### Project Goal
 Think of an online gallery (focusing on painting) where is safe to browse, it is friendly and professional response to the needs of  art lovers, learners and artists  who are looking for experiencing a better way communication with each other through the concepts and inspirations.

### Customer Goals
The Gallry must be very friendly and easy to navigate. The visitors should feel a motivative and live environment without getting too tired too soon. The visitors will get to know the art works, artists and concepts behind artworks. They will learn from the artists original comments and inspired by the artists themselves. Artist also will find an environment where they can express themselves notonly by their art work but alno their own words and educational video clips or comments.

- there should be easy and comfortable ways of contacting and communicating with Ordak Gellery management 
- Ordering art pieces shouild be easy and without worrying about online scam
- Most important thing is that the visitors should not be pushed for buying the art pieces and visitors should not be targeted by emails and so they should not feel so. The aim is to create a better life style for all and art can help to achieve it.


## Features

- Home
- Gallery Albums
- Inspirations
- Interesting links
- Reading materials etc.
- Contact Page

### Coding Structure

- uploaded media files are separated to videos and images both under assets folder
- Images and videos folder has subfolders named after each artists. The names are first letter of first name and last name. For example a folder belong to Van Gogh would be vg.
- Under each artist folder there is an artwork and inspiration (insp) folder separating gallery and inspirations files.
- Bootstrap version is 4.3.1
- font-awesom link is not added inside the <head></head> because it does not exist under Bootstrap version 4.3.1 and it might not be necessary!!!!

### Coding Structure

- hover effect is copies from https://cdnjs.com/libraries?q=hover
- Galley Rooms is the same as Art Works of the menue. I choose different name to check the user feedback

### Potential Future Developments and plans
- Provide a mini biography (preferreably an autobiography) for the artists
- Adding a simple paragfraph to each artwork so visitors could get connected with the them
- Creating a 2D imaginary gallery plot with rooms  and sallons with hovering and selecting capabilities. Each room  is dedicated to a single artist and some exhibitions could be held there.
- Possibly a rating system based on number of view , visitor rating, and feedback
- Adding a filtering system so user can filter the type of art work based on style, demdia , artist etc
- Sorting system for sorting the displayed pictures
- More interesting sources for reading and more inspiration places and also places to visit will be added
- Based on user experience colours need improvement

### Visitors stories
- A visitor artist pleased by using more vibrant colours at this stage.
- A site visitor mentioned that the gallery is simple to browse and potentially usefull to learn from
- Another site visitor menioned about its  nice appearance and also meaningful logo

###  Further fix to be done
- The menues hover functionality need improvement
- There was an error for launching videoes and popup pictures on gitpod so those features are removed but need to be resolved
- the pdf file under Reading tab does not appear in gitpot but the files and the links are still there

### Notes
- Only one artist could send an approval for using her works and the rest of the artist will reply soon.
- Displayed pictures are permitted to use
- The home page and general idea is inspired from Mini Project with Bootstrap 4 module
- The contact form is more or less the same as the initial code of the Mini Project with Bootstrap 4 module
