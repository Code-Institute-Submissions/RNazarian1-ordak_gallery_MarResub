##### Milestone project 1 (Prepared for the User Code Institute/Centric Frontend Development module)

Direct link to the project is [here.](https://github.com/RNazarian1/ordak_gallery.git)

### Project Goal
No artist name no price tag. Think of an online gallery (focusing on painting) where is safe to browse and being inspired. The goal is not usual. Here the aim is ro establish a communication with the visitors and get their feedback and opinion on art pieces. It aims to earn the honest feedback from visitors without knowing the artist and the prices. By knowing the user's feeling it would be possible to instate a better communication in order to fullfill their art desire. The price is not the first aim but creating an environment for visitors to express their opinion and need via email.

- there should be easy and comfortable ways of contacting and communicating with Ordak Gellery management 
- It is important that the visitors should not be pushed for buying the art pieces and visitors should not be targeted by marketting emails.

### Website Overview
Ordak Gallry does not provide any price tag or artist name and users need to contact the galley if they are motivated by the pice(s). All other art gallery websites  try to sell the art by highlighting  artist fame and the history of the piece so users are considered to be collectioners or investors. The purpose here is to create a link with visitors and help them in choosing the right piece of art without destracted by commercial side.The aim is to educate visitors about art and help them to enjoy artworks. There are pages with links to external material for reading, visiting or even apply for a degree in art.
At the end those hwo has sent email will be reached for further advise on buing/renting or getting familiar with artpieces.


### Website Description and Demonstration

The website is trying to put an experimental approach into test on art (painting) business by focusing more on the art by itself rather than the other usual galleries where the price and fame of the artist is the heart of the business. 
Website benefits from different page entries each has useful material to attract and entertain the visitors.




### Business Strategy

Usual online galleries provide too many options with a lots of details which is mostly useeful for collectors ,art dealers and investors. Usually displaying the price tag and the name of the artist makes decision very difficult for the visitor. The usual methods creates a distraction for visitors and usually makes the visitor left and right brain lobes fight with eachother therfore most of the time people afraid of going to a gallery for enjoyment and self indulge. Users are always welcome to start a converstion regarding their interest and if they are interested they can evaluate the economical side of it. In case they are not comfortable with the art price an alternative cheeper solution will be provided to them by cunsulting with Ordak Gallery.

### Business Goal
- The major goal is to benefit from art markrt business opportunities in a cheatic market which is difficult to penetrate and stay sustainable.
- There are many talents who are living under the shadow of famous figures or does not have a propper platform to promote their works. It is tried to promote those talents through an innovative approach.
- The website is focused on painting therefore should be soon a base for many artists
- Art market needs different approach to reach paintings and their creators.

----------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to promote art by serving the visitors with motivations and finally bring art lovers and artists together with through selected artworks.


## Website Features

- Home
- Gallery Albums
- Inspirations
- Interesting links
- Reading materials etc.
- Contact Page

### Coding Structure

- uploaded media files are separated to videos and images both under assets folder
- Images and videos folder has subfolders named after each artists. The names are first letter of first name and last name. For example a folder belong to Van Gogh would be vg.
- Under each artist folder there is an artwork and inspiration (insp) folder separating gallery and inspirations files.
- Bootstrap version is 4.3.1
- font-awesom link is not added inside the <head></head> because it does not exist under Bootstrap version 4.3.1 and it might not be necessary!!!!

### Coding Structure

- hover effect is copies from https://cdnjs.com/libraries?q=hover
- Galley Rooms is the same as Art Works of the menue. I choose different name to check the user feedback

### Potential Future Developments and plans
- Provide a mini biography (preferreably an autobiography) for the artists
- Adding a simple paragfraph to each artwork so visitors could get connected with the them
- Creating a 2D imaginary gallery plot with rooms  and sallons with hovering and selecting capabilities. Each room  is dedicated to a single artist and some exhibitions could be held there.
- Possibly a rating system based on number of view , visitor rating, and feedback
- Adding a filtering system so user can filter the type of art work based on style, demdia , artist etc
- Sorting system for sorting the displayed pictures
- More interesting sources for reading and more inspiration places and also places to visit will be added
- Based on user experience colours need improvement

### Visitors stories
- A visitor artist pleased by using more vibrant colours at this stage.
- A site visitor mentioned that the gallery is simple to browse and potentially usefull to learn from
- Another site visitor menioned about its  nice appearance and also meaningful logo

###  Further fix to be done
- The menues hover functionality need improvement
- There was an error for launching videoes and popup pictures on gitpod so those features are removed but need to be resolved
- the pdf file under Reading tab does not appear in gitpot but the files and the links are still there

### Notes
- Only one artist could send an approval for using her works and the rest of the artist will reply soon.
- Displayed pictures are permitted to use
- The home page and general idea is inspired from Mini Project with Bootstrap 4 module
- The contact form is more or less the same as the initial code of the Mini Project with Bootstrap 4 module







Web site requires to be happy and there should not be any complexity and without any convoluted structure. The target visitor is a vide range specially those who may not be quite familiar with complex type of websites. It is very friendly and easy to navigate. The visitors should feel motivated and benefit from a live environment without getting lost to what they are looking for. The visitors will get to know the art works, artists and concepts behind artworks if they feel good about the art after contacting the gallery and they will learn from the artists original comments and will and inspired by the artists themselves. Artist also will find an environment where they can express themselves not only by their art work but also their own words if visitor shows interest. There is he and educational links or comments.
